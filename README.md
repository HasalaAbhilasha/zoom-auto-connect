# Zoom Auto Connect

Automate Microsoft Power Automate Zoom reconnection after the 40-minute meeting limit.

This repository contains a Microsoft Power Automate flow that automates the process of reconnecting to a Zoom meeting after the 40-minute time limit has been reached. This can be especially useful for users who are utilizing the free version of Zoom and want a seamless way to automatically reconnect to their ongoing meetings.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the Zoom Auto Connect flow:

1. **Open Microsoft Power Automate**: If you haven't already, log in to your Microsoft Power Automate account.

2. **Create a New Flow:**
   - Click on the "My flows" tab in the left-hand navigation panel.
   - Click the "+ New" button to create a new flow.

3. **Paste Code into Flow Area:**

4. **Save:**
   - Once you have configured the flow with the necessary actions, give your flow a meaningful name.
   - Click the "Save" button to save your flow.

5. **Copy Zoom Link to Clipboard:**
   - Before the Zoom meeting starts, copy the Zoom meeting link to your clipboard.

6. **Run the Program:**
   - The flow you created will now automatically monitor the time and trigger the reconnection process after 40 minutes.
   - When you receive a notification or the flow executes, it will automatically open the Zoom link you copied and reconnect you to the meeting.

Please note that the exact implementation of the flow might vary based on your specific requirements and the changes in the Microsoft Power Automate interface.
